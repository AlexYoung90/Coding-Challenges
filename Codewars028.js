/**Write a function that always returns 5

Sounds easy right? Just bear in mind that you can't use any of the following characters: 0123456789*+-/

Good luck :) */

// an easy way to make this function always return 5 would be to create an array with 5 items in it and then return the length 
function unusualFive() {
    const arrayOfFive = ['item','item','item','item','item']
    return arrayOfFive.length
  }
